## About Us 🧫🧬
The overarching goal of our research is to understand the intersection of common and rare disease genetics to uncover the genetic architecture and molecular mechanisms of human disease. We take a conceptually innovative approach to our research, bridging genomics and classic genetics, integrating informatic, molecular, translational, and clinical approaches, to investigate our hypotheses and perform our work.

Our lab has a particular focus on disorders affecting the primary cilium, but our science is guided by genetic discovery and we are excited to tackle interesting questions agnostic of organ system or disease pathogenesis.
